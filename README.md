<p>This repository is where I keep notes on my journey of learning Java language. 
Most of the writings here will be in Turkish language mixed with English words.
On the way, I will probably learn other things that are not closely related with Java language.
And I will store here notes about those knowledges too.
But things in this repository will always be centered around programming languages and
computer world.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Therefore, there will be no running codes, scripts, programs in this repository. 
But there will be incomplete codes here and there which will sometimes only makes sense to me.
This is a personal source of knowledge for me to able to go back and remember something if I forget them.
I will not store in this repository unimportant diary notes. For such notes, I created<br>
https://github.com/seyitserdarcihan/MyAnyNotes</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>If it is personal, why on Earth do I make this public?
This is a notebook sort of diary and there is nothing personally personal here, if you know what I mean. 
I call this kind of notebooks <em>publicly personal register</em>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Why on Earth did I write readme file in English language if the repository contents are in Turkish?
Because, I imagined a person who is a native Turkish speaker and knows enough English to be able to learn Java.
He comes across my repository and finds many notes in a language he finds most familiar in his own 
Learning Java Journey.</p>
