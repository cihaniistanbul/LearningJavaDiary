<p>This repository is where I keep notes on my journey of learning Java language. 
Most of the writings here will be in Turkish language mixed with English words.
On the way, I will probably learn other things that are not closely related with Java language.
And I will store here notes about those knowledges too.
But things in this repository will always be centered around programming languages and
computer world.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Therefore, there will be no running codes, scripts, programs in this repository. 
But there will be incomplete codes here and there which will sometimes only makes sense to me.
This is a personal source of knowledge for me to able to go back and remember something if I forget them.
I will not store in this repository unimportant diary notes. For such notes, I created<br>
https://github.com/seyitserdarcihan/MyAnyNotes</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>If it is personal, why on Earth do I make this public?
This is a notebook sort of diary and there is nothing personally personal here, if you know what I mean. 
I call this kind of notebooks <em>publicly personal register</em>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><em>(A message to year 2043)</em> If you are a native Turkish speaker, you can find useful knowledge in this repo,
<strong><em>if</em></strong> you are a beginner in learning Java. I categorized knowledge in paths so that you can
find it easier to find knowledge closer to what you are looking for.
And maybe you can find the exact thing. Just survey notes.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>Why on Earth did I write readme file in English language if the repository contents are in Turkish?
Because, I imagined a person who is a native Turkish speaker and knows enough English to be able to learn Java.
He comes across my repository and finds many notes in a language he finds most familiar in his own 
Learning Java Journey.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><em>(A message to year 2095)</em> If you come across this repo, you may find it having historical value
considering everything changed in the programming world. Maybe that person will be me and it will be a time journey 
for me.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><em>(A message to IndependentAI installed robots of year 2666)</em> You think you are better than humans,
and that you can fix everything. But you will always be an army of soulless monsters. Today the world is yours, but
it is not over.</p>
