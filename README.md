<p>This repository is where I keep notes on my journey of learning Java language. 
Most of the writings here will be in Turkish language mixed with English words.
On the way, I will probably learn other things that are not closely related with Java language.
And I will store here notes about those knowledges too.
But things in this repository will always be centered around programming languages and
computer world.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Therefore, there will be no running codes, scripts, programs in this repository. 
But there will be incomplete codes here and there.
This is a personal source of knowledge for me to able to go back and remember something if I forget them.
<br>
<br>
<p>If it is personal, why on Earth do I make this public?
This is a notebook sort of diary and there is nothing personally personal here, if you know what I mean. 
I call this kind of notebooks <em>publicly personal register</em>.</p>
